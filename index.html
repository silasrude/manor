  <h4>Manor 1</h4>
  <p>Apt.2 Hot water side of bathtub faucet. Very pleased to find parts for this.</p>

  <p>Hose bib north side. Has a slow leak. Someone attached a grounding strap to it. Poorly. This is a bad idea for a few reasons. Something I still need to fix.</p>

  <h4>Manor 3</h4>
  <p>Apt. 205 Maybe a third of the sand flushed out of the cold water line in the kitchen. This was over 2 weeks after I flushed them the first time. I can't believe how much sand and mud I have flushed out of these water lines.</p>
